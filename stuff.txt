Thing to mention during game demo:
- How we determine the difficulty of each level (longer pathways = harder, etc.)
- Player's choice carries risk/reward (using sonar will alert enemy, if not might fall into traps, etc.)
- Timing to get stars is dynamic. Theytill automatically update depending on the player's performance.
